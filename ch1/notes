ESSENCE OF REACTIVIY

"This is the essence of reactivity: outputs automatically react (recalculate) when their inputs change".

You create a reactive expression by wrapping a block of code in reactive({...}) and assigning it to a variable, and you use a reactive expression by calling it like a function. But while it looks like youâ€™re calling a function, a reactive expression has an important difference: it only runs the first time it is called and then it caches its result until it needs to be updated.
